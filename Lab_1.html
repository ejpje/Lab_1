			<p>Once upon a time there was a mouse who wanted to be a dragon. The mouse admired dragons for their courage, their ferocity, and their independence, but did not know how to become one. One dreary, rainy day, snuggled in its den, the mouse read about a dragon expert who lived in London.
				The mouse decided to go to London to learn how to be a dragon.</p>
